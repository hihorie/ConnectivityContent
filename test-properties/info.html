        From the home page www.expedia.com:

        <ol>
            <li>Select the Hotels icon in the booking wizard box</li>
            <li>Under Going To type Region Test which will auto correct to Region Test (and vicinity)</li>
            <li>Enter dates in the future that you are sure have been updated with rates and availability.  Update number of rooms, adults and children per your test preference</li>
            <li>

                <img src="/images/test-properties/info-search.png"/>
                The next page is called the Search Results.
            </li>
            <li>
                To narrow the results use the “Search by hotel name” feature, enter all or some of your test hotel name, select your hotel from list and select Go
                <br/>
                If you have not sent over rates and inventory your hotel will not appear, if you just sent over rates and availability allow approximately 30 minutes for the cache to update

            </li>
        </ol>

    <h2 id="book">Booking your Test hotel on Expedia</h2>
    <p>
        Once you find your test hotel, click on the price to make a booking.
        <img src="/images/test-properties/info-booking.png"/>
        On the hotel rooms and rates page, select the book button <span><img src="/images/test-properties/info-book.png" style="height: 2em;"></span> to begin the booking process.  We suggest you code and test for both Pay Now/Expedia Collect and Pay at Hotel/Hotel Collect.
    </p>
    <p>
        To complete the booking you will need to enter a valid form of payment that will be charged for the Pay Now option.  Your booking will be refundable as long as you cancel it prior to the date of check-in.  Here are the items needed to complete the booking.
        <ul>
            <li>First/Last Name</li>
            <li>Phone</li>
            <li>Debit/Credit Card Number</li>
            <li>Expiration Month/Year</li>
            <li>Security Code</li>
            <li>Cardholder Name</li>
            <li>Email</li>
            <li>Password to create account</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>A booking confirmation will be sent to the email you enter and that email will also include a link for cancelling the booking.</p>
    <p>At this point we recommend that you create an account.  Once you create an account you can find all your bookings under the “My Trips” section which may make it easier to cancel all test bookings.</p>
