40+ futurists gathered in Prague to brainstorm, create and present their solutions to drive more bookings and revenue for hotels, using current and experimental APIs.

The hackathon provided us direct feedback: nearly 50 actionable improvements. Our teams are busy converting these into working solutions to drive increased benefits to hoteliers and simplify adoption of our API's.

We invite you to watch this video that captures the vibe, energy and productivity of this event.
