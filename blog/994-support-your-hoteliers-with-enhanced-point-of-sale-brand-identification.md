**What's New?**
Expedia is expanding Point of Sale Brand information passed through our APIs so property partners can recognize the booking point of sale from our dynamic portfolio of travel brands. Without proper Point of Sale Brand information being passed to your properties, guests can be greeted as having booked from a different Point of Sale Brand upon check-in, which can lead to customer confusion and poor customer experience.

**When Can I See Enhanced Point of Sale Brand Identification? **
Beginning May 1st, you can begin adopting the changes. This feature is a requirement for all connections and any future certifications, so please ensure that your system supports our enhanced list of brands in order to remain compliant with our certification standards.

**What Does this Mean?**
Your system must be able to accept additional values for brands that will be sent over your Booking API. This includes the ability to consume and pass the relevant brand information to the PMS so hoteliers can see the proper Point of Sale Brand information in the reservation details when checking in their guests.

**How Does it Work?**
Point of Sale Brand information is already being passed to you in bookings today for the following Points of Sale:

*   Expedia
*   Hotels.com
*   Expedia Affiliate Network

We will continue to use the same field in our APIs, and simply begin sending additional values. The newly added Points of Sale are as follows:

*   Egencia
*   Travelocity
*   Orbitz
*   Wotif
*   Hotwire
*   CheapTickets
*   Ebookers
*   MrJet
*   Lastminute.au
*   American Express Travel
*   Amex The Hotel Collection
*   Amex FINE HOTELS AND RESORTS

**What Do I Need to Do?**
To support this critical feature, first review the applicable API Specifications to understand the required updates, then make any changes necessary to ensure that your system can accept the new Point of Sale Brands and pass them to the PMS.

**PMS is the Key!**
Consuming the new Point of Sale Brands is not enough on its own. It is critical that the Point of Sale Brand information is also passed to all of the PMS providers your systems connect with. To certify that you have completed this work, you must provide a screenshot from a PMS partner displaying that the new Point of Sale Brands reaches these PMS systems.

**Don’t Wait to Take Action!**
Supporting the new Point of Sale Brands is a requirement for certification. Contact your Account Manager or [EQC System Specialist Team](mailto:eqcss@expedia.com?Subject=Question%20about%20supporting%20enhanced%20POS) to send your confirmation and screenshot example today. If you are unable to meet this compliance, please contact your Account Manager or [EQC System Specialist Team](mailto:eqcss@expedia.com?Subject=Question%20about%20supporting%20enhanced%20POS).
