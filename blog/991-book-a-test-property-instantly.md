Whether you have just started working with Expedia, or are onboarding a new product, it always pays to test your connectivity solution. Previously you had to contact Expedia directly to request a test property.

Now, you can avoid the hassle and take control with our new online test property tool. Benefits include:

* **No waiting**. With an instant confirmation, you can start testing straight away.
* **Ready to use**. Receive a test property for exclusive use for your connection, in our production environment.
* **Easy reset**. Forgot your property credentials?  Reset them online.
* **More flexibility**. You can extend your booking up to two weeks into the future.
