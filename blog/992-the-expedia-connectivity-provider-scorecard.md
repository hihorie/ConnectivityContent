Hotel and lodging partners rely on our connected platforms to help power their business and attract guests. Whether you’re a channel manager, central reservation system or property management system, a strong connection to Expedia will result in happy customers and help grow your business.

It’s important that all connected systems meet standards and operate at top performance. As a Connectivity partner, we want to ensure that you understand the health of your connection and are aware of opportunities for improvement.

We’ve created the Expedia Connectivity Provider Scorecard (see [example](https://expediaconnectivity.com/provider-scorecard/)) to provide transparency and fairness in our Connectivity partner assessments. This dynamic evaluation tells you how you’re doing and how you compare among other Connectivity providers.

We track and measure three primary areas of our partnership cycle – Optimize, Enhance and Grow. Each of these areas contains related metrics about the quality of your connection.

**Optimize**
This area measures your efficiency and speed when interacting with Expedia’s inventory management and reservations functions. You can also see your activation and property onboarding metrics.

**Enhance**
This section reflects the status of your adoption of important features that enhance guest experiences and provide advanced options for lodging partners.

**Grow**
The metrics in this area offer details on your overall supply and success of your connected properties in the Expedia marketplace. You can monitor the effectiveness of the rates and availability provided by your lodging partners.

If you haven’t received your scorecard or have questions, contact your account manager or email [EQCSS@expedia.com](mailto:EQCSS@expedia.com?Subject=Provider scorecard inquiry) to request it.
