    <h3>Hackathon Event</h3>
        <ul>
            <li id="li-question"><b>How much time will we have?</b>&nbsp;You will have the time between when we start the hackathon till when the judging begins. Some teams will work late into the night to get as far as they can before the judging, but this is not required.</li>
            <li id="li-question"><b>Can we prepare?</b>&nbsp;YES! There are many things you can do to prepare. Here are some ideas:
                <ul>
                    <li id="li-question">Refine / clarify the problem you are trying to solve</li>
                    <li id="li-question">Read up on the APIs you plan to use</li>
                    <li id="li-question">Write and test sample code that calls the APIs you plan to use</li>
                    <li id="li-question">Ask your Expedia Hackathon coach for suggestions</li>

                </ul> 
                While you won't use your sample code in your hackathon project, the experience you gain through the above efforts will help you make more effective use of your time during the hackathon. You are expected to write the code for your project <em>during the hackathon.</em></li>
