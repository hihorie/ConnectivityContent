# Getting Connected

**Thank you for your interest in connecting with Expedia.**
Below is a summary to get your system connected to our APIs.

### 1. Development phase
All our API specifications are on this site.  You must abide by our [terms and conditions](/terms.html).
If you have any development related questions during this phase, please send email [eqcss@expedia.com](mailto:eqcss@expedia.com).

### 2. Test phase
We'll send you access details for a test property in production once you send the following information to [eqcss@expedia.com](mailto:eqcss@expedia.com):

* Company name
* System Type (CRS, PMS, Channel Manager, etc)
* System name
* Address
* Phone number
* Contact information
* Website
* How many hotels utilize your system?
* System description
 
In order to assign a property that will suit your needs we need to know more about what you have coded for. Please return a completed [interface questionnaire](/files/EQC%20Interface%20Questionnaire.docx) to [eqcss@expedia.com](mailto:eqcss@expedia.com).
 
 
### 3. Beta (Soft Launch) phase
If testing is successful, select one of your hotels to be Beta and return a completed [enrollment form](/files/EQC%20Enrollment%20Form.docx) to [eqcss@expedia.com](mailto:eqcss@expedia.com) so we can initiate the Soft Launch process (one hour phone call with testing plan, one week monitoring in production with a real hotel). There are also some [soft launch scenarios](/files/EQC%20Softlaunch%20Scenarios.docx) to view.
      
### 4. Go Live phase
After soft launch is over (usually it takes one week), the connectivity will be officially up and running in production and other properties can be connected.
