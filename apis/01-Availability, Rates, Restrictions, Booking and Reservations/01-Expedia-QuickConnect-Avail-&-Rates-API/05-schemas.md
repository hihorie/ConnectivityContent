## Availability and Rates Request (AR RQ)
### AR RQ Schema Overview
Please note that this overview provides the most recent structure of EQC AR API (namespace http://www.expediaconnect.com/EQC/AR/2011/06). The API actually also supports the previous version of the schema (namespace http://www.expediaconnect.com/EQC/AR/2007/02), without the repeatable AvailRateUpdate element. The XSD file for the AR RQ API available on http://www.expediaquickconnect.com also supports both the old and new format under the new version.
