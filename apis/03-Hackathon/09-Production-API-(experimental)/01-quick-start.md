# Quick Start
Production APIs allows Expedia Inc. to provide supplier analytic and performance reporting, both to MM and Hotel partners.

## Authentication
The API uses a Basic Authorization scheme. The same credentials used to manage properties via our public APIs today are compatible with the Production API. Authorization will also be performed: the hotel must be assigned to the API account being used.

## Warning: mocked data!
This API was designed to enable Madrid Hackathon participants to experiment with the idea of learning more about Production data.
It was all built with mocked data and will not return real data. The logic to return responses will be detailed in the sample messages below.

Moreover, this API will only be able to return data to the hotels reserved via the test hotel reservation tool on this portal. Any other hotel will not return any data.
