# Expedia Connectivity API Documentation

Contributions to the API documentation on the Expedia Connectivity site can be made via the [ConnectivityContent](https://github.com/ExpediaInc/ConnectivityContent) GitHub repository.  This can be done in place using GitHub's web interface or using a `git` tool to clone the repo locally.  The steps below are for using GitHub's web interface.


<br/>

### Step 1. Locate file to edit

Find the files you wish to contribute to in [the repository](https://github.com/ExpediaInc/ConnectivityContent) under the "apis" folder. The folder structure under apis follows the structure of the site, usually <API category>/<API name>/<page file>. Each page is represented as a seperate .md file, usually with a numerical sequence prefix.

<br/>
### Step 2. Making changes

#### Editing a text file

Once you have found the page and clicked on it a set of icons is presented to edit the page e.g `Edit this file` pencil-icon, and `Delete this file` bin-icon.  Click the `Edit this file` button to use Github's in bowser editor.  From here, you may make changes to the markdown files.  Help with writing markdown is available at the [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

To view what your changes will look like, click the `preview` button - all changes will be kept, there is no need to save your work.

#### Uploading an image or file

To upload an image or other file, please navigate to [/files](https://github.com/ExpediaInc/ConnectivityContent/tree/master/files) in the repo, click `Upload files` and then upload your images or files to a new branch and create a pull request. Once your branch is merged to master, it will shortly be available at http://expediaconnectivity.com/files/<your file name>



<br/>
### Step 3. Committing/saving changes

To commit (a.k.a. save) your changes, scroll to the bottom of the currently edited page to the "commit change" form. Fill out the form with a description of the changes you have made, select the option `Create a new branch` and add a branch name.  Then click `Propose File Change`.

If you have more changes to make you can return to the [main repository](https://github.com/ExpediaInc/ConnectivityContent). Select your branch (if currently `master`), and navigate/change more pages, committing changes to the same branch each time, until all your changes are complete.

Once all your changes are complete you can submit a pull request.





<br/>
### Step 4. Suggesting changes

Open a pull request - there may be a form on the current web page if you did not make more changes.  If not, go to the main repository and click [pull requests](https://github.com/ExpediaInc/ConnectivityContent/pulls) (or visit the link).
* Enter a title and description for the changes in the pull request.
* Click `Create pull request`

Your pull request has now been submitted for review and if accepted will be merged into the master branch.  Thanks for contributing!
