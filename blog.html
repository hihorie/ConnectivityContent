                <div class="blog-content">Expedia is expanding Value Add Promotions to all of our Global Accounts at the beginning of July.
                <br><br>
<strong>What does this mean?</strong> Your customers will be invited to create Value Add Promotions for Expedia Brand Websites. To be successful, your systems must pass the relevant information down to the PMS so that your customers can view Value Add information in the reservation details.
                <br><br>
<strong>What are Value Add Promotions?</strong> This new promotion feature allows properties to create travel deals which provide additional value without lowering room rates. For example, free spa credits for free breakfast.
                <br><br>
<strong>What To Do Today:</strong>
Validate that you can support the new Special Request field to support this critical feature in Expedia Bookings.
                <br><br>
<u><a href="https://developer.expediapartnercentral.com/apis/availability-rates-restrictions-booking-and-reservations/eqc-api/reference.html">EQC AP Specification</a></u>
                <br><br>
<strong>Donâ€™t wait to Take Action:</strong> Supporting Value Add Promotions is a requirement for certification. If you cannot support Value Add Promotions at this time, please contact your Account Manager. We will work with you to ensure you are prepared before July.
                <br><br>
We trust you will be able to adjust your integration with Expedia quickly and in time to provide the added benefits to your customers. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact EQCSS or your account manager.

                <div class="blog-content">While there are many things that change in the world of Expedia Connectivity, there are a few things that will likely remain the same. First is that we will continue to look for ways to make it easier for you to do business with us. The second is that we will deliver new functionality incrementally.
                <br/><br/>
                Last year when we released the Product API, we made it possible for partners to create and modify rate plans. Naturally, over time, partners have inactivated rate plans that were no longer useful to them. These unused rate plans have an impact on response times and system processing. In addition, unused rate plans create confusion that can make it more difficult for hotel managers to update their room rates. This difficulty can result in costly errors.
                <br/><br/>
                As of a recent Product release, it is now possible to use the HTTP DELETE verb with the Product API to delete a rate plan. To begin using this new feature in your application and make life easier for hotel managers, please refer to the API documentation for <a href="/apis/product-management/product-api/reference.html">Product Delete</a>.
