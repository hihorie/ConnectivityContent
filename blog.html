              We would like to inform our Expedia QuickConnect users that we're working on changes that will require updates by our users.
              <br/><br/>
              <strong>New domain name for Expedia QuickConnect APIs Using Dynamic IP Addressing</strong>
              <br/><br/>
              At Expedia we strive to build the best and most robust APIs in order to make sure you and your customers can run your business without disruption. 
              As part of our next upgrade, on February 28th, 2017, we plan to replace the current production domain for the Expedia QuickConnect services (https://ws.expediaquickconnect.com/) with a new one: <a href="https://services.expediapartnercentral.com/">https://services.expediapartnercentral.com/</a>
              <br/><br/>
              We kindly ask you to adopt the new domain before <b>February 28th, 2017</b>. The new endpoints are available today.
              <br/><br/>
              With this new domain, the IP addresses will dynamically change over time and therefore you should use our fully qualified domain name. Please do not attempt to configure connectivity based on an IP address.
              <br/><br/>
              Here’s how the different paths to EQC messages are changing:

              <br/><br/>
              <strong>Replace PARR with the more modern Product API</strong>
              Several months ago we have introduced the Product API. In addition to read room type and rate plan setting, the new API allows you to create and modify products and thus drive efficiency for you and your customers. 
              We invite you to take a look at the Product API on <a href="https://expediaconnectivity.com/developer">https://expediaconnectivity.com/developer</a>. 
              <br/><br/>
              Going forward, EQC PARR API will not be enhanced with new features.
              <br/><br/>
              If you are using EQC PARR for the availability and rates retrieval feature, stay tuned. We will have more updates for you in 2017.
              <br/><br/>
              <strong>New self-service test property assignment tool; EQC Simulator to be retired</strong>
              We’re excited to announce the release of a new feature enabling you to reserve test properties for all your testing needs. 
              This new self-service feature allows for more robust and complete testing. Log in to <a href="https://expediaconnectivity.com/test-properties/">https://expediaconnectivity.com/test-properties/</a> with your EPC user credentials to get started. If you need to reserve a test property, and you forgot your password, please use the “forgot password” of the https://www.expediapartnercentral.com login page. 
              If you forgot your username, please reach out to <a href="mailto:hothelp@expedia.com">hothelp@expedia.com</a> to obtain it.
              <br/><br/>
              Expedia will proceed with decommissioning the Expedia QuickConnect Simulator for EQC AR, BR, BC and PARR applications. The simulators will go offline on January 27th, 2017. Please make sure to use the new test property assignment feature for all your testing needs going forward.
              <br/><br/>
              For any questions or concerns about these changes, please reach out to our support specialists at <a href="mailto:eqcss@expedia.com">eqcss@expedia.com</a>.

                <strong>What are Value Add Promotions?</strong> This new promotion allows properties to create travel deals that provide additional value without lowering room rates. For example, free spa credits or a free breakfast with a booking.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                <strong>When are Value Add Promotions Going Live?</strong> Expedia is expanding Value Add Promotions to all of our Global Partners in July and we are requiring all of our Connectivity Partners to support Value Add Promotions by July 15th.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                <strong>What Does this Mean?</strong> Your customers will be invited to create Value Add Promotions for Expedia Brand Websites. To be successful, your systems must consume and pass the relevant information down to the PMS so that your customers can view Value Add information in the reservation details when checking in their guests.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                <strong>How Does it Work?</strong> Value Add Promotions information is being passed to you in bookings in a new Special Request field. Expedia previously sent 5 Special Request fields already, and we are simply adding a 6th Special Request field for Value Adds information. Many Connectivity Partners who support Value Adds have found either no work or very limited work was required.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                For Partners on Expedia QuickConnect (EQC) – Specifics on Value Adds and the new Special Request 6 field can be found in the <a href="/apis/availability-rates-restrictions-booking-notification-retrieval-and-confirmation/expedia-quickconnect-booking-retrieval-confirmation-api/reference-br.html#booking-retrieval-response-complete-schema-definition">Expedia QuickConnect Booking Retrieval API Definition section</a>. A specific examples of Special Request 6 in the XML can be found in the <a href="/apis/availability-rates-restrictions-booking-notification-retrieval-and-confirmation/expedia-quickconnect-booking-retrieval-confirmation-api/examples.html#booking-retrieval-response-2-new-bookings-returned-with-value-add-promotion">Sample Messages</a> sections.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                For Partners on Booking Notification – Specifics on Value Adds and the new Special Request 6 field can be found in the "Hotel Reservation Notification RQ/RS" section of the <a href="/apis/availability-rates-restrictions-booking-notification-retrieval-and-confirmation/booking-notification-api/reference.html#ota_hotelresnotifrq">Booking Notification API Definition</a>.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                <strong>What To Do Today?</strong> Review the EQC Booking Retrieval specification to make sure that you can support the new Special Request field to support this critical feature in Expedia Bookings. If you cannot support it yet please designate time for your teams to work on making any mapping changes or updates required to support it by <strong>July 15th, 2016</strong>.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                <strong>PMS is the Key!</strong> Consuming the Special Request field is not enough on its own. It is critical that the Value Add information is also passed to all of the PMS providers you connect with.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                <strong>Don’t Wait to Take Action!</strong> Supporting Value Add Promotions is a requirement for certification. Please take a minute to let us know where you are in the process of adopting Value Adds <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/S2cvhQHwiYxjixA42">here</a>. If you cannot support Value Add Promotions at this time, please contact your Account Manager or <a href="mailto:eqcss@expedia.com?Subject=Question%20about%20supporting%20value%20add%20promotions">EQC Self Service</a>. We will work with you to ensure you are prepared by July.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                We trust you will be able to adjust your integration with Expedia quickly and in time to provide the added benefits to your customers. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact <a href="mailto:eqcss@expedia.com?Subject=Question%20about%20supporting%20value%20add%20promotions">EQC Self Service</a> or your Account Manager.

            <div class="blog-content">While there are many things that change in the world of Expedia Connectivity, there are a few things that will likely remain the same. First is that we will continue to look for ways to make it easier for you to do business with us. The second is that we will deliver new functionality incrementally.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                Last year when we released the Product API, we made it possible for partners to create and modify rate plans. Naturally, over time, partners have inactivated rate plans that were no longer useful to them. These unused rate plans have an impact on response times and system processing. In addition, unused rate plans create confusion that can make it more difficult for hotel managers to update their room rates. This difficulty can result in costly errors.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                As of a recent Product release, it is now possible to use the HTTP DELETE verb with the Product API to delete a rate plan. To begin using this new feature in your application and make life easier for hotel managers, please refer to the API documentation for
