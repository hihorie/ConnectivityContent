              <h3>Are your bookings failing due to outdated API schemas?</h3><br/><br/>

              <strong>What changed?</strong><br/>
              The booking schemas used by the Expedia Booking Notification and Booking Retrieval APIs have been updated to support changes to the number of Special Request fields Expedia is sending. Previously these APIs only supported up to 5 special requests, but we recently added a 6th special request to support Value Add Promotions and are expanding the schema to accommodate 99 Special Requests to avoid any issues in the future.
              <br/><br/>
              <strong>What do I need to do?</strong><br/>
              If your system is using the Expedia schemas to perform schema validations on the booking notification request messages or booking retrieval response messages sent by Expedia, please download the new schemas from the developer portal to ensure all of bookings for your properties are delivered successfully.
              <ul>
                  <li>Expedia Booking Notification API – <a target="_blank" href="/apis/availability-rates-restrictions-booking-notification-retrieval-and-confirmation/booking-notification-api/schemas.html">XML Schemas</a></li>
                  <li>Expedia QuickConnect Booking Retrieval & Confirmation API – <a target="_blank" "https://expediaconnectivity.com/apis/availability-rates-restrictions-booking-notification-retrieval-and-confirmation/expedia-quickconnect-booking-retrieval-confirmation-api/xml-schemas.html">XML Schemas</a></li>
              </ul>
              <strong>What if I have questions or feedback?</strong><br/>
              If you’ve successfully downloaded the latest schema and aren’t facing any issues, or even if you’ve run into issues or your system is not able to accommodate our schema changes, please let us know in our partner feedback form found here(I’ll need to set up a GoogleForm to gather responses).
              <br/><br/>

              <h3>Do you support Expedia’s new configurations for bedding and occupancy?</h3><br/><br/>

              <strong>What changed?</strong><br/>
              Expedia is changing the bedding and occupancy configuration for the room types to make it more clear and accurate for our customers and partners. The new bedding configuration impacts the Booking Notification and Booking Retrieval APIs. Expedia will continue sending bed type information in the Special Request field, but will start sending new bed type descriptions. The new bed type descriptions will be generated from the new bedding configurations and will be in free-form text instead of the fixed values defined by the current API. We are moving to free-text descriptions over codes, so that we can better represent the diversity of lodging bedding configurations.
              <br/><br/>
              <strong>What does this mean and what do I need to do?</strong><br/>
              This means that the bed type free-text descriptions will need to be passed to the PMS, so please ensure that the bed-type is passed to the PMS via string rather than by bed-type code. If your systems are using the Expedia Booking Notification API or the Expedia QuickConnect Booking Retrieval API, we need your feedback on the following questions, which can be answered in the following response form: (GoogleForm)
              <ul>
                <li>Is your system able to accept any bed type description (free-form text) and pass it on to the hotelier (PMS)?</li>
                <li>Is your system able to accept any bed type code (ex. code 1.5 for multiple beds)?</li>
                <li>There is an edge case for room types with multiple bedding options such as “1 king bed” or “2 double beds”, when the customer selects one of the bedding options to book, the accurate bed type description will be sent in the booking notification or booking retrieval message. But the bed type code may not be accurate in these multiple bedding option scenarios. Could this edge case cause any issue for you or your PMS integrations? Is your system capable of ignoring the bed type code and consume only the bed type description?</li>
              </ul>
              <br/>
              If you are a partner using the Product API, you can create a room type with the new bedding and occupancy configuration through the API. Please refer to the <a target="_blank" href="https://expediaconnectivity.com/apis/product-management/product-api/reference.html">Expedia Product API documentation</a> for examples.

                <strong>What are Value Add Promotions?</strong> This new promotion allows properties to create travel deals that provide additional value without lowering room rates. For example, free spa credits or a free breakfast with a booking.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                <strong>When are Value Add Promotions Going Live?</strong> Expedia is expanding Value Add Promotions to all of our Global Partners in July and we are requiring all of our Connectivity Partners to support Value Add Promotions by July 15th.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                <strong>What Does this Mean?</strong> Your customers will be invited to create Value Add Promotions for Expedia Brand Websites. To be successful, your systems must consume and pass the relevant information down to the PMS so that your customers can view Value Add information in the reservation details when checking in their guests.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                <strong>How Does it Work?</strong> Value Add Promotions information is being passed to you in bookings in a new Special Request field. Expedia previously sent 5 Special Request fields already, and we are simply adding a 6th Special Request field for Value Adds information. Many Connectivity Partners who support Value Adds have found either no work or very limited work was required.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                For Partners on Expedia QuickConnect (EQC) – Specifics on Value Adds and the new Special Request 6 field can be found in the <a href="/apis/availability-rates-restrictions-booking-notification-retrieval-and-confirmation/expedia-quickconnect-booking-retrieval-confirmation-api/reference-br.html#booking-retrieval-response-complete-schema-definition">Expedia QuickConnect Booking Retrieval API Definition section</a>.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                <strong>What To Do Today?</strong> Review the EQC Booking Retrieval specification to make sure that you can support the new Special Request field to support this critical feature in Expedia Bookings. If you cannot support it yet please designate time for your teams to work on making any mapping changes or updates required to support it by <strong>July 15th, 2016</strong>.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                <strong>PMS is the Key!</strong> Consuming the Special Request field is not enough on its own. It is critical that the Value Add information is also passed to all of the PMS providers you connect with.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                <strong>Don’t Wait to Take Action!</strong> Supporting Value Add Promotions is a requirement for certification. Please take a minute to let us know where you are in the process of adopting Value Adds <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/S2cvhQHwiYxjixA42">here</a>. If you cannot support Value Add Promotions at this time, please contact your Account Manager or <a href="mailto:eqcss@expedia.com?Subject=Question%20about%20supporting%20value%20add%20promotions">EQC Self Service</a>. We will work with you to ensure you are prepared by July.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                We trust you will be able to adjust your integration with Expedia quickly and in time to provide the added benefits to your customers. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact <a href="mailto:eqcss@expedia.com?Subject=Question%20about%20supporting%20value%20add%20promotions">EQC Self Service</a> or your Account Manager.

First is that we will continue to look for ways to make it easier for you to do business with us. The second is that we will deliver new functionality incrementally.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                Last year when we released the Product API, we made it possible for partners to create and modify rate plans. Naturally, over time, partners have inactivated rate plans that were no longer useful to them. These unused rate plans have an impact on response times and system processing. In addition, unused rate plans create confusion that can make it more difficult for hotel managers to update their room rates. This difficulty can result in costly errors.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                As of a recent Product release, it is now possible to use the HTTP DELETE verb with the Product API to delete a rate plan. To begin using this new feature in your application and make life easier for hotel managers, please refer to the API documentation for
